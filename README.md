I'm creating a bitcoin self custody course using digisteps because I'm tired of seeing people getting scammed by regulated exchanges.

Self Custodial Bitcoin is our best defense against getting Mt. Goxed or FTX'd.

If you know how to improve it, please create an issue or make a pull request.


Digisteps is Free and Open Software. I am currently running this on Yunohost on a virtual private server. I included the HTML, but that's not how I am editing it.

I am experiminting with the value 4 value model. This particular project could especially use some value in the form of **time** and **talent**. 

Please help make this better.
