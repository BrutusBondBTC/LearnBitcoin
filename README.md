# LearnBitcoin
I'm creating a bitcoin self custody course using digisteps because I'm tired of seeing people getting scammed by regulated exchanges.

Self Custodial Bitcoin is our best defense against getting Mt. Goxed or FTX'd.

If you know how to improve it, please create an issue or make a pull request.


Digisteps is Free and Open Software. I am currently running this on Yunohost on a virtual private server. If you have an idea or want tocontribute let me know and I'll try to include it in the course. 

The idea is to create a baby steps course taking someone from precoiner to hardcore multisig master while learning how to use bitocin along the way. 

Bitcoin is compliocated if you try to explain it all at once, but my goal is to make it more digestable by providing background informatiion and scaffolding the content.


I am experiminting with the value 4 value model. This particular project could especially use some value in the form of **time** and **talent**. 

Please help make this better.
